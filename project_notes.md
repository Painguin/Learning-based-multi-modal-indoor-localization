## Handling missing data

- Putting values to 0
> - Makes the attribute irrelevant
> - Might be an issue if 0 makes sense for some attribute

## Handling sequence

- Recurrent neural network

- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

---



# Evaluation

Split the data into a train set and a test set. The test set would be used only as a final result.  
Then split the train set into a true train set and validation set to test different nn architectures and different hyperparameters.  
To have more robust statistics, cross-validation and/or multiple trials can be done which would provide mean and variance estimations.
